        <div><h5>Our Story</h5><br><p>Eluscent started as a simple idea for one of my school projects. I wanted to create something unique and meaningful—something that people could connect with. That’s when I thought about perfume. Scents have a special way of bringing back memories and emotions, and I wanted to turn that into something real.

        At first, it was just a concept for a business website. But as I worked on it, I realized that I was putting a lot of effort into something I actually enjoyed doing. It may not be a real brand or business, but I wanted it to feel like one—even just for this project.
        
        Even though this started as a requirement, I really put in my effort and passion. My goal is to inspire others with the idea that every scent tells a story—and I hope Eluscent becomes a part of yours.</p></div>
